# Dimple

A [Hoplon][hoplon] wrapper for the [Dimple][3] charting library.

## Dependency

[![latest version][2]][1]

## Usage

A very basic dimple implementation.
Provides one element - chart-basic - for a reactive chart, then leaves the rest of the customisation up to you.
## Data

Provide data to dimple as a vector of maps, like this:

    (def data [{"Item" "Chair" "Weight" 5   "Height" 100}
               {"Item" "Desk"  "Weight" 100 "Height" 100}
               {"Item" "Lamp"  "Weight" 20  "Height" 20}])

## Simple bar chart example

    (def sentence "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. The lazy dog was annoyed by this but didn't do anything because he was lazy.
                   In effect, the quick brown fox had got away with his reckless jumping once again.")

    (def letter-frequencies
      (for [[char f] (frequencies sentence)]
        {"Letter" (str char) "Frequency" f}))
